**P**ipelined **R**elational **Q**uery **L**anguage, pronounced "Prequel".

PRQL is a modern language for transforming data — a simpler and more powerful
SQL. Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a
logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables
and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it
transpiles to SQL.

PRQL was discussed on [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30060784#30062329) and
[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/oavgcx/prql_simpler_more_powerful_sql) earlier
this year when it was just a proposal.

Here's a short example of the language; for more examples, visit
[prql-lang.org][prql website]. To experiment with PRQL in the browser, check out
[PRQL Playground][prql playground].

```elm
from employees                                # Each line transforms the previous result.
filter start_date > @2021-01-01               # Clear date syntax.
derive [                                      # `derive` adds columns / variables.
  gross_salary = salary + payroll_tax,
  gross_cost = gross_salary + benefits_cost   # Variables can use other variables.
]
filter gross_cost > 0
group [title, country] (                      # `group` runs a pipeline over each group.
  aggregate [                                 # `aggregate` reduces each group to a row.
    average salary,
    sum     salary,
    average gross_salary,
    sum     gross_salary,
    average gross_cost,
    sum_gross_cost = sum gross_cost,          # `=` sets a column name.
    ct = count,
  ]
)
sort [sum_gross_cost, -country]               # `-country` means descending order.
filter ct > 200
take 20
```
