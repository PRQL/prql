**P**ipelined **R**elational **Q**uery **L**anguage, pronounced "Prequel".

PRQL is a modern language for transforming data — a simple, powerful, pipelined
SQL replacement. Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a
logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables
and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it
transpiles to SQL.

PRQL can be as simple as:

```elm
from employees
filter country == "USA"                       # Each line transforms the previous result.
aggregate [                                   # `aggregate` reduces column to a value.
  max salary,
  min salary,
  count,                                      # Closing commas are allowed :)
]
```

Here's a fuller example of the language;

```elm
from employees
filter start_date > @2021-01-01               # Clear date syntax.
derive [                                      # `derive` adds columns / variables.
  gross_salary = salary + (tax ?? 0),         # Terse coalesce
  gross_cost = gross_salary + benefits_cost,  # Variables can use other variables.
]
filter gross_cost > 0
group [title, country] (                      # `group` runs a pipeline over each group.
  aggregate [                                 # `aggregate` reduces each group to a row.
    average gross_salary,
    sum_gross_cost = sum gross_cost,          # `=` sets a column name.
  ]
)
filter sum_gross_cost > 100000                # Identical syntax for SQL's `WHERE` & `HAVING`.
derive id = f"{title}_{country}"              # F-strings like python.
sort [sum_gross_cost, -country]               # `-country` means descending order.
take 1..20                                    # Range expressions (also valid here as `take 20`).
```
