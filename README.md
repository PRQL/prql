**P**ipelined **R**elational **Q**uery **L**anguage, pronounced "Prequel".

PRQL is a modern language for transforming data — a simple, powerful, pipelined
SQL replacement. Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and declarative.
Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations,
and supports abstractions such as variables and functions.
It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it
compiles to SQL.

PRQL can be as simple as:

```elm
from employees
filter country == "USA"                       # Each line transforms the previous result
aggregate [                                   # `aggregate` reduces column to a value
  max salary,
  min salary,
  count,                                      # Closing commas are allowed :)
]
```

Here's a fuller example of the language;

```elm
from employees
filter start_date > @2021-01-01               # Clear date syntax
derive [                                      # `derive` adds columns / variables
  gross_salary = salary + (tax ?? 0),         # Terse coalesce
  gross_cost = gross_salary + benefits_cost,  # Variables can use other variables
]
filter gross_cost > 0
group [title, country] (                      # `group` runs a pipeline over each group
  aggregate [                                 # `aggregate` reduces each group to a row
    average gross_salary,
    sum_gross_cost = sum gross_cost,          # `=` sets a column name
  ]
)
filter sum_gross_cost > 100000                # Identical syntax for SQL's `WHERE` & `HAVING`
derive id = f"{title}_{country}"              # F-strings like python
derive country_code = s"LEFT(country, 2)"     # S-strings allow using SQL as an escape hatch
sort [sum_gross_cost, -country]               # `-country` means descending order
take 1..20                                    # Range expressions (also valid here as `take 20`)
```
