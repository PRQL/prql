```elm
# Task: rank the employee titles according to the average salary for each department.

# My solution:
# - for each employee, find their average salary,
# - join employees with their departments and titles (duplicating employees for each of their titles and departments)
# - group by department and title, aggregating average salary
# - join with department to get department name

from salaries
aggregate by:[emp_no] [
  emp_salary: average salary
]
join t:titles [emp_no]
join dept_emp side:left [emp_no]
aggregate by:[dept_emp.dept_no, t.title] [
  avg_salary: average emp_salary
]
join departments [dept_no]
select [dept_name, title, avg_salary]

# Note that this solution contains a common pitfall in the first few lines:
# We don't need to use `employees` table at all, because we could only aggregate `salaries` table by `emp_no`.
```
