# Grammars / syntax highlighting

PRQL contains multiple grammar definitions to enable tools to highlight PRQL
code. These are all intended to provide as good an experience as the grammar
supports. Please raise any shortcomings in a GitHub issue.

The definitions are somewhat scattered around the codebase; this page serves as
an index.

  ([prql_highlight_rules.js](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/master/src/mode/prql_highlight_rules.js)).
