# Minimalist Code of Conduct

We prefer keeping our rules as short as possible and filling the gaps with the
mortar of human interaction: empathy.

All we ask of members of this project is this:

- Please treat each other with respect and understanding.
- Please respect our wish to not serve as a stage for disputes about fairness or
  personal differences.

If you can agree to these conditions, your contributions are welcome. If you can
not, please don’t spoil it for the rest of us.
