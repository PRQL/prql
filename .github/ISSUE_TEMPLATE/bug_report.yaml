        Please confirm that the bug report is minimal and doesn't exist already:

        - **Minimal example** ‚Äî the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in PRQL. For example, it's not possible to exclude any line and still observe the bug.

        - **New issue** ‚Äî a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.
