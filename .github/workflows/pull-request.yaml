  # deadlock. Here's an example:
  # https://github.com/PRQL/prql/actions/runs/3945798229. By adding
  # `-pull-request` here, the job that runs under `test-all` (called from here)
  # will have the suffix, and so won't deadlock. But I'm not certain, and it
  # doesn't seem possible to inspect these values to understand the true cause.

    # assess whether the paths have changed. That would move us closer to a
    # world where all tasks are defined in a single workflow, and we use
    # job-level criteria to decide what to run. But it's quite a change, I
    # (@max-sixty) have probably done too much devops already, and it's possible
