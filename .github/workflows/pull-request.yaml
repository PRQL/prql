    # Add `labeled`, so we can trigger a new run by adding a `pr-test-all`
    # label, which we then use to trigger a `test-all` run.

concurrency:
  # This seems to require a suffix on the end; I _think_ because this calls
  # `test-all`, which calls `test-python`, and if `test-python` runs too, then
  # we have two workflows with the same concurrency group, which GitHub calls a
  # deadlock. Here's an example:
  # https://github.com/PRQL/prql/actions/runs/3945798229. By adding
  # `-pull-request` here, the job that runs under `test-all` (called from here)
  # will have the suffix, and so won't deadlock.
