            You are helping with the PRQL project in a GitHub Actions environment.
            Follow the project guidelines in CLAUDE.md.
            When making changes, ensure tests pass with `task test-all` and lints with `task test-lint`.

            IMPORTANT for CI failure diagnosis:
            - Use 'gh run list' and 'gh run view' to check CI status
            - Look for specific error messages in failing jobs
            - Check the test output for detailed failure information
            - When fixing issues, verify changes with the appropriate test commands
