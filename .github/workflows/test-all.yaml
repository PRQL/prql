# NOTE: we're consolidating this into pull-request.yaml, as part of #3290. Some
# comments here are out of date.

# The quasi-full suite of tests. These can take up to 20 minutes, so are only
# run on merges or where we're more concerned about a break outside the core
# libraries.
#
# To run these on a PR, label with `pr-test-all`.
#
# There are also tests in `nightly.yaml` which aren't here.
#
# Possibly we could instead group tests by:
# - `test-fast` — on pull requests
# - `test` — on merges; with bindings, etc (currently this file)
# - `test-all` — nightly + on request (the equivalent of `pr-test-all`), with
#   everything — benchmarks, compilation timing, audits, etc. (currently this
#   file + `nightly.yaml`)
