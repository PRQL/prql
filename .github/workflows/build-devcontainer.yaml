    # We could push this on the stable branch (currently named `web`) if we
    # needed a clearer release schedule.
    # We don't run on every merge to main because:
    # - I'm not sure whether starting a new devcontainer pulls a new image every
    #   time, which would be annoying when there are no changes (maybe it's the
    #   same but relies on the cache working perfertly)
    # - The arm64 build is very very slow, takes 2-3 hours, so we don't want to
    #   run it excessively.
    #
    # If the cache works reliably, we can remove this path restriction and run on every merge.
