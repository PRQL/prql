# Code of Conduct

We prefer keeping our rules as short as possible and filling the gaps with the
mortar of human interaction: empathy.

All we ask of members of this project is this:

- Please treat each other with respect and understanding.
- Please respect our wish to not serve as a stage for disputes about fairness or
  personal differences.

If you can agree to these conditions, your contributions are welcome. If you can
not, please donâ€™t spoil it for the rest of us.

To report a violation of these rules, please email
[prql@prql-lang.org](mailto:prql@prql-lang.org) or contact one of the
[project maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/PRQL/people).
