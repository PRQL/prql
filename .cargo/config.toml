# Use rust-lld to handle long symbol names from Chumsky's generic types
# See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/141626#issuecomment-2919988483

# Note: Python bindings override this in prqlc/bindings/prqlc-python/.cargo/config.toml
# because maturin requires macOS-specific linker flags that rust-lld doesn't support.
