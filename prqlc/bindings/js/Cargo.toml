# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. While the docs state that "This is great
# for development, but requires all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking`
# infrastructure, so isn't great for code size when deploying.", on testing with
# `--no-default-features`,
# `prql/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/prql_js.wasm` is 7.416MB vs
# 7.408MB. Maybe because we're already including lots of that with other library
# features? Even running `wasm-opt prql_js.wasm` makes similarly sized files of
# 5.7M. Feel free to try removing this as part of reducing code size (would be
# good to have a much smaller code size...).
