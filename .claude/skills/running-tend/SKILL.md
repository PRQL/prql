# Running Tend in PRQL

Tend-specific guidance for this repo. Project build commands, test strategy,
error conventions, etc. are in `CLAUDE.md` — don't duplicate them here.

## Filing issues in other repos

Standing exception granted: file directly in agent-equipped targets (per
**Filing Issues in Other Repos** in the bundled `running-in-ci` skill) without
asking permission here first. The default rule (open an issue here asking
permission first) still applies when the target shows no agent signals.

## PR conventions

- PR titles use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`,
  `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `internal:`, `devops:`, `web:`, `refine:`
- No scope required (e.g., `fix: resolve date parsing` not `fix(parser): ...`)
- Dependabot PRs use `chore:` prefix

## CI structure

- Main CI workflow: `tests` (watched by tend-ci-fix)
- Dependency management: Dependabot opens dependency PRs; tend-weekly reviews
  them and runs the tasks under Weekly maintenance below.
- Automerge: not configured — `pull-request-target.yaml` only validates PR
  titles and handles `pr-backport-web` backports. The automerge job was removed
  in #5753, so bot PRs must be merged manually by a maintainer (or via repo
  branch-protection auto-merge if a maintainer enables it on the PR).

## Background tasks

When a Bash command exceeds its tool timeout, the harness auto-backgrounds it
and the tool result reads `Command running in background with ID: bgXXXX.
Output is being written to: …/bgXXXX.output. You will be notified when it
completes.` The notification arrives as a `<task-notification>` user message
— there is **no `.completed` marker file**, only the `.output` file.

Do not start a `run_in_background: true` `until [ -f …/bgXXXX.completed ]; do
sleep N; done` loop to wait for it. That loop polls forever (the marker never
appears), and because it's running in background the session can't reap it.
When the session ends, the orphan shell + sleep keep the runner alive until
the workflow's `timeout-minutes` cap, which converts an otherwise successful
run into `cancelled` (see [max-sixty/tend#594](https://github.com/max-sixty/tend/issues/594)
for a 5h40m incident on this repo).

Instead: continue with other work after the auto-background. The task
notification re-enters the session; act on it then.

## Weekly maintenance

These tasks run as Step 3 of the bundled weekly skill (only when
`workflows.weekly` is enabled in `.config/tend.yaml`).

- **Bump pinned `go-task/setup-task` version.** The action is invoked with a
  concrete `version:` input to avoid the intermittent
  `unable to get latest version` failure from `version: 3.x` (see #5836).
  Dependabot does not update `with:` inputs, so this needs a manual weekly bump.
  Find the latest release at <https://github.com/go-task/task/releases/latest>;
  if the current pin is older, update `version: X.Y.Z` in:
  - `.github/actions/tend-setup/action.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/build-web.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/test-php.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/test-prqlc-c.yaml`

  Open a single `chore:` PR with the bump. Skip if already at the latest.

## Issue management

- Close bot-opened issues once the underlying cause is resolved — don't leave
  them open for a maintainer. If you (prql-bot) filed an issue (e.g., a nightly
  "tests failed" issue, a code-quality issue, an infra/upstream bug report) and
  the fix has merged or the upstream problem has been addressed, close the issue
  with a short comment citing the resolution (e.g., "Resolved by #NNNN —
  closing"). Applies to any issue where `author.login == prql-bot`.
