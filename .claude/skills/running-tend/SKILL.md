# Running Tend in PRQL

Tend-specific guidance for this repo. Project build commands, test strategy,
error conventions, etc. are in `CLAUDE.md` — don't duplicate them here.

## Filing issues in other repos

Standing exception granted: file directly in agent-equipped targets (per
**Filing Issues in Other Repos** in the bundled `running-in-ci` skill) without
asking permission here first. The default rule (open an issue here asking
permission first) still applies when the target shows no agent signals.

## PR conventions

- PR titles use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`,
  `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `internal:`, `devops:`, `web:`, `refine:`
- No scope required (e.g., `fix: resolve date parsing` not `fix(parser): ...`)
- Dependabot PRs use `chore:` prefix

## CI structure

- Main CI workflow: `tests` (watched by tend-ci-fix)
- Dependency management: Dependabot opens dependency PRs; tend-weekly reviews
  them and runs the tasks under Weekly maintenance below.
- **tend's own action is excluded from Dependabot** (`max-sixty/tend` is in the
  github-actions `ignore` list in `.github/dependabot.yaml`). Tend updates flow
  through the nightly `tend/update-workflows` regen (`uvx tend init`), which
  follows structural changes a version-only bump can't — e.g. the 0.1.7 move
  that split the action into `claude/`/`codex/` subdirectories broke the naive
  Dependabot bump #6031. Don't re-add `max-sixty/tend` to Dependabot.
- **Don't hand-edit a generated `tend-*.yaml` workflow file when a regen PR is
  open.** The nightly `tend/update-workflows` regen bundles individual fixes
  under the generic title `chore: update tend workflows`, so a title-keyword
  dedup before `gh pr create` won't surface it — the change you're about to make
  by hand may already be in that open PR. Before opening a manual stopgap edit
  to a generated workflow, diff the file against the open regen PR (compare by
  the _file path_ it touches, not the title) or route the change through
  `.config/tend.yaml` so the regen carries it. Landing both independently
  double-applies the change: on 2026-06-24 a manual `allow-unsafe-pr-checkout`
  stopgap (#6038) collided with the same line in the open 0.1.7 regen (#6033,
  titled "update tend workflows"); both merged, leaving a duplicate `with:` key
  that broke `lint-megalinter`/`actionlint` on `main` and required a ci-fix PR
  (#6039).
- Automerge: not configured — `pull-request-target.yaml` only validates PR
  titles and handles `pr-backport-web` backports. The automerge job was removed
  in #5753, so bot PRs must be merged manually by a maintainer (or via repo
  branch-protection auto-merge if a maintainer enables it on the PR).

## Weekly maintenance

These tasks run as Step 3 of the bundled weekly skill (only when
`workflows.weekly` is enabled in `.config/tend.yaml`).

- **Bump pinned `go-task/setup-task` version.** The action is invoked with a
  concrete `version:` input to avoid the intermittent
  `unable to get latest version` failure from `version: 3.x` (see #5836).
  Dependabot does not update `with:` inputs, so this needs a manual weekly bump.
  Find the latest release at <https://github.com/go-task/task/releases/latest>;
  if the current pin is older, update `version: X.Y.Z` in:
  - `.github/actions/tend-setup/action.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/build-web.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/test-php.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/test-prqlc-c.yaml`

  Open a single `chore:` PR with the bump. Skip if already at the latest.

## Issue management

- Close bot-opened issues once the underlying cause is resolved — don't leave
  them open for a maintainer. If you (prql-bot) filed an issue (e.g., a nightly
  "tests failed" issue, a code-quality issue, an infra/upstream bug report) and
  the fix has merged or the upstream problem has been addressed, close the issue
  with a short comment citing the resolution (e.g., "Resolved by #NNNN —
  closing"). Applies to any issue where `author.login == prql-bot`.
