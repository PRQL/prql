# Pipelines

### The simplest pipeline

The simplest pipeline is just:

```prql
from employees
```

### Adding transformations

We can add additional lines, each one transforms the result:

```prql
from employees
derive gross_salary = (salary + payroll_tax)
```

...and so on:

```prql
from employees
derive gross_salary = (salary + payroll_tax)
sort gross_salary
```
