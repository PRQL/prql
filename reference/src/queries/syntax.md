# Syntax

## Line-breaks & `|` character

A line-break generally pipes the result of that line into the transform on
the following line. For example, the `filter` and `select` transform operates on
the result of the previous line:

```prql
from employees
filter department == "Product"
select [first_name, last_name]
```

In the place of a line-break, it's also possible to use the `|` character to
pipe results:

```prql
from employees | filter department == "Product" | select [first_name, last_name]
```

A line-break doesn't created a pipeline in a couple of cases:

- Within a list (e.g. the `derive` examples below).
- When the following line is a new statement, by starting with a keyword such as
  `func`.

## Lists

Lists are represented with `[]`, and can span multiple lines. A final trailing
comma is optional.

```prql
derive [x = 1, y = 2]
derive [
  a = x,
  b = y
]
derive [
  c = a,
  d = b,
]
```
