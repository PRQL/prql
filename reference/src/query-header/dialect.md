# Dialect

PRQL allows specifying a dialect at the top of the query, which allows PRQL to
compile to a database-specific SQL flavor.

## Examples

```prql
prql dialect:postgres

from employees
sort age
take 10
```

```prql
prql dialect:mssql

from employees
sort age
take 10
```

## Supported dialects

> Note that dialect support is _very_ early â€” most differences are not
> implemented, and most dialects' implementations are identical to `generic`'s.
> Contributions are very welcome.
