# S-Strings

An s-string inserts SQL directly, as an escape hatch when there's something that PRQL
doesn't yet implement. For example, there's no `version()` function in SQL that
returns the Postgres version, so if we want to use that, we use an s-string:

```prql
from x
select db_version: s"version()"
```

...produces...

```sql
SELECT
  version() AS db_version
FROM
  x
```

We can embed columns in an f-string using braces. For example, PRQL's standard
library defines the `average` function as:

```prql
func average column = s"AVG({column})"
```

So that:

```prql
from x
aggregate average value
```

...produces...

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(value)
FROM
  x
```

For those who have used python, it's similar in to a python f-string, but the
result is SQL, rather than a string literal â€” a python f-string
would produce `"average(salary)"`, with the quotes.
