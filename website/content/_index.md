  title: "Principles"
  items:
    - title: "Pipelined"
      main_text: "PRQL is a linear pipeline of transformations"
      content: "Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line’s result. This makes it easy to read, and simple to write."

    - title: "Simple"
      main_text: "PRQL serves both sophisticated engineers and analyst's without coding experience."
      content: |
        We believe that there should be only one way of expressing each operation,
        so there is only a few patterns to memorize. This opposes query tweaking with
        intention to improve performance, because that should be handled by the compiler and
        the database.

    - title: "Open"
      main_text: "PRQL will always be open-source"
      content: "Free-as-in-free, and doesn’t prioritize one database over others. By compiling to SQL, PRQL is instantly compatible with most databases, and existing tools or programming languages that manage SQL. Where possible, PRQL unifies syntax across databases."

    - title: "Extensible"
      main_text: "PRQL can be extended through its abstractions"
      content: "Its explicit versioning allows changes without breaking backward-compatibility. PRQL allows embedding SQL through S-Strings, where PRQL doesn’t yet have an implementation."

    - title: "Analytical"
      main_text: "PRQL’s focus is analytical queries"
      content: "We de-emphasize other SQL features such as inserting data or transactions."

####################### SQL Section #########################
showcase_section:
  enable: true
  title: "Showcase"
  subtitile: "Get familiar with your data"
  content:
    - "Even though wildly adopted and readable as a sentence, SQL is inconsistent and becomes unmanageable as soon as query complexity goes beyond the most simple queries."
    - "Because each transform in PRQL is orthogonal to all previous transforms, it is always easy to extend your query. On top of that, PRQL offers modern features, such syntax for dates, ranges and f-strings as well as functions, type checking and better null handling."
