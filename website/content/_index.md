  title: "Why PRQL?"
  items:
    - title: For data engineers
      content:
        - PRQL is concise, with abstractions such as variables & functions
        - PRQL is database agnostic, compiling to many dialects of SQL
        - PRQL isn't limiting — it can contain embedded SQL where necessary
        - PRQL has bindings to most major languages _(and more are in progress)_
        - PRQL allows for column lineage and type inspection _(in progress)_
    - title: For analysts
      content:
        - PRQL is ergonomic for data exploration — for example, commenting out a
          filter, or a column in a list, maintains a valid query
        - PRQL is simple, and easy to understand, with a small number of
          powerful concepts
        - PRQL allows for powerful autocomplete, type-checking, and helpful
          error messages _(in progress)_
    - title: For tools
      content:
        - PRQL is a stable foundation to build on; we're open-source and will
          never have a commercial product
        - PRQL is a single secular standard which tools can target
        - PRQL is easy for machines to read & write
    - title: For HackerNews enthusiasts
      content:
        - The PRQL compiler is written in rust
        - We talk about "orthogonal language features" a lot

showcase_section:
  enable: true
  title: "Showcase"
  content:
    - PRQL consists of a curated set of orthogonal transformations, which are
      combined together to form a pipeline. That makes it easy to compose and
      extend queries. The language also benefits from modern features, such
      syntax for dates, ranges and f-strings as well as functions, type checking
      and better null handling.

principles_section:
  enable: true
  title: "Principles"
  items:
    - title: "Pipelined"
      main_text: "A PRQL query is a linear pipeline of transformations"
      content:
        Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line’s
        result. This makes it easy to read, and simple to write.

    - title: "Simple"
      main_text:
        "PRQL serves both sophisticated engineers and analysts without coding
        experience."
      content:
        By providing a small number of powerful & orthogonal primitives, queries
        are simple and composable — there's only one way of expressing each
        operation. We can eschew the debt that SQL has built up.

    - title: "Open"
      main_text: "PRQL is open-source, with an open community"
      content:
        PRQL will always be fully open-source and will never have a commercial
        product. By compiling to SQL, PRQL is compatible with most databases,
        existing tools, and programming languages that manage SQL. We're a
        welcoming community for users, contributors, and other projects.

    - title: "Extensible"
      main_text:
        "PRQL is designed to be extended, from functions to language bindings"
      content:
        PRQL has abstractions which make it a great platform to build on. Its
        explicit versioning allows changes without breaking
        backward-compatibility. And in the cases where PRQL doesn't yet have an
        implementation, it allows embedding SQL with S-Strings.

    - title: "Analytical"
      main_text: "PRQL's focus is analytical queries"
      content:
        PRQL was originally designed to serve the growing need of writing
        analytical queries, emphasizing data transformations, development speed,
        and readability. We de-emphasize other SQL features such as inserting
        data or transactions.
