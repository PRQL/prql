  title: "Principles"
  items:
    - title: "Pipelined"
      main_text: "A PRQL query is a linear pipeline of transformations"
      content:
        Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line’s result.
        This makes it easy to read, and simple to write.

    - title: "Simple"
      main_text: "PRQL serves both sophisticated engineers and analysts without coding experience."
      content:
        By providing a small number of powerful & orthogonal primitives, queries are simpler —
        there's only one way of expressing each operation. We can eschew the debt that SQL has built up.

    - title: "Open"
      main_text: "PRQL will always be open-source"
      content:
        PRQL is free-as-in-free, will never have a commercial product, and doesn’t prioritize one database over others.
        By compiling to SQL, PRQL is instantly compatible with most databases, and existing tools or programming languages that manage SQL.
        Where possible, PRQL unifies syntax across databases.

    - title: "Extensible"
      main_text: "PRQL can be extended through functions"
      content: PRQL has abstractions which make it a great platform to build on.
        Its explicit versioning allows changes without breaking backward-compatibility.
        And in the cases where PRQL doesn't yet have an implementation, it allows embedding SQL with S-Strings.

    - title: "Analytical"
      main_text: "PRQL's focus is analytical queries"
      content: We de-emphasize other SQL features such as inserting data or transactions.

showcase_section:
  enable: true
  title: "Showcase"
  content:
    - PRQL consists of a curated set of orthogonal transformations, which are combined together to form a pipeline.
      That makes it easy to compose and extend queries. The language also benefits from modern features, such syntax for dates, ranges and f-strings as well as functions, type checking and better null handling.
