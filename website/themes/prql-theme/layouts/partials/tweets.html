          - Move the content of the testimonial into `_index.md` so we can have a
          few of these, and templated. (maybe renaming this page from tweets to
          something more general?)
          - Format the testimonial more like a "card" in the other sections, including a light
          border. Currently it has an idiosyncratic blue border only on the left. Do
          we need to unify some of `card` format in style.css across the sections?
          - Currently the items overlap at some monitor sizes — can we prevent
          that? Does the browser seem to think the items are smaller than they are?
