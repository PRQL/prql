        TODO:
        - The font in the card seems different to the rest of the site?
        - Move the content of the testimonial into `_index.md` so we can have a
          few, and templated (may require
          renaming this page from tweets to something more general)
        - Format the testimonial more like a "card" in the other sections, including a light
          border. Currently it has a slightly odd blue border only on the left.
        - Currently the items overlap at some monitor sizes — can we prevent
          that? Does the browser seem to think the items are smaller than they are?
