# in the transpiler.

# Aggregate Functions

func min column = s"MIN({column})"
func max column = s"MAX({column})"
func sum column = s"SUM({column})"
func avg column = s"AVG({column})"
func stddev column = s"STDDEV({column})"
func average column = s"AVG({column})"
func count = s"COUNT(*)"
func count column = s"COUNT({column})"
# TODO: Possibly make this into `count distinct:true` (or like `distinct:` as an
# abbreviation of that?)
func count_distinct column = s"COUNT(DISTINCT `{column}`)"

# TODO: Introduce a notation for getting start and end out of a ranges
# could be range.0? or range.start? But to make this happen, we need to make
# changes to how variables are resolved.
func in range value = s"{value} BETWEEN {range}"

# Casting functions

func as column type = s"CAST({column} AS {type})"
