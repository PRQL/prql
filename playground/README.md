# PRQL Playground

A fast-feedback compiler from PRQL to SQL, hosted at <https://prql-lang.org/playground/>

To run locally, [set up a development
environment](../DEVELOPMENT.md#development-environment), and then run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes

This currently uses `wasm-react-scripts` instead of `react-scripts`, until
<https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8303> is merged.
