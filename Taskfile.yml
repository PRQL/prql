# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json

# This file gives new contributors an easy way to get everything they need,
# assuming `cargo` and [Task](https://taskfile.dev) are installed.

# Beyond installing requirements, we generally shouldn't be using this as a
# Makefile, requiring running this to have a good dev loop — rust tools are
# independently good, and adding an intermediate layer means we're
# reimplementing things or getting in the way. Instead, this can be used to
# aggregate commands that's are currently separate; e.g. check out `test-all`.

# Some of the file may be somewhat over-engineered!
