# This file gives new contributors an easy way to get everything they need,
# assuming they have `cargo` and `Taskfile`.

# Generally we shouldn't be requiring running this to have a good dev loop —
# rust tools are independently good, and adding an intermediate layer means we're
# reimplementing things or getting in the way. Instead, this can be used to
# aggregate commands that's aren't yet integrated.

# Some of the file may be somewhat over-engineered!
