# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json

# This file gives new contributors an easy way to get everything they need,
# assuming `cargo` and [Task](https://taskfile.dev) are installed.

# Beyond installing requirements, we generally shouldn't be using this as a
# Makefile — in other words, we shouldn't require running this as part of normal
# development. Rust tools are independently good, and adding an intermediate
# layer means we're reimplementing things or getting in the way. Instead, this
# can be used to aggregate commands that are currently separate; e.g. check out
# `test-all`.

# Some of the file may be somewhat over-engineered!
