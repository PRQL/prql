# Examples

These examples are rewritten from other languages such as SQL. They try to express real-world problems in PRQL, covering most of the language features. We are looking for different use-cases of data transformation, be it database queries, semantic business modeling or data cleaning.

If you want to help, translate some of your queries to PRQL and [open a PR](https://github.com/prql/prql/pulls) to add them here!
