# Visual Studio Code extension

PRQL has a Visual Studio Code extension that compiles a PRQL query in a VS Code
editor and displays the resulting SQL code in a second pane on the side. This is
very handy for editing, saving, and reusing PRQL queries in VS Code.

To install the VS Code extension, open VS Code and type Ctl-Shift-P (Cmd-Shift-P
on a Mac) and type `PRQL`. Install the extension as usual.
