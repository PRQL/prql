# VSCode Extension

PRQL has a VScode Extension that compiles a PRQL query in a VScode pane and
displays the resulting SQL code in a second pane on the side. This is very handy
for editing, saving, and reusing PRQL queries in VScode.

To install the VSCode extension, open VSCode and type Ctl-Shift-P (Cmd-Shift-P
on a Mac) and type `PRQL`. Install the extension as usual.
