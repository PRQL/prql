# Regex expressions

```admonish note
At this time, PRQL does not have a facility for regular expression (_regex_) processing.
The [Milestone for 0.5](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/milestone/5)
talks about general plans for regex's.
The [Discussion #1123](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues/1123#issuecomment-1354209472)
provides a workaround function that emulates `%LIKE%`.
