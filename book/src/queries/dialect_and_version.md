# Query header: Dialect & Version

## Dialect

PRQL allows specifying a dialect at the top of the query, which allows PRQL to
compile to a database-specific SQL flavor.

### Examples

```prql
prql dialect:postgres

from employees
sort age
take 10
```

```prql
prql dialect:mssql

from employees
sort age
take 10
```

### Supported dialects

> Note that dialect support is _very_ early â€” most differences are not
> implemented, and most dialects' implementations are identical to `generic`'s.
> Contributions are very welcome.

- `ansi`
- `bigquery`
- `clickhouse`
- `generic`
- `hive`
- `mssql`
- `mysql`
- `postgres`
- `sqlite`
- `snowflake`

## Version

PRQL allows specifying a version of the language in the PRQL header, like:

```prql
prql version:1

from employees
```

When the functionality is implemented, it will allow the language to evolve
without breaking existing queries.
