## Summary

A summary of PRQL syntax

<!-- The `|` characters need to be escaped, and surrounded with tags rather than backticks -->

## Pipes

Pipes — the connection between [transforms](../transforms.md) that make up a
pipeline — can be either line breaks or a pipe character (`|`).

In almost all situations, line-breaks pipe the result of a line's transform into the transform on
the following line. For example, the `filter` transform operates on the result
of `from employees` (which is just the `employees` table), and the `select` transform operates on
the result of the `filter` transform.

```prql
from employees
filter department == "Product"
select [first_name, last_name]
```

In the place of a line-break, it's also possible to use the `|` character to
pipe results, such that this is equivalent:

```prql
from employees | filter department == "Product" | select [first_name, last_name]
```

A line-break doesn't create a pipeline in a couple of cases:

- within a list (e.g. the `derive` examples below),
- when the following line is a new statement, which starts with a keyword of
  `func`, `table` or `from`.

## Lists

Lists are represented with `[]`, and can span multiple lines. A final trailing
comma is optional.

```prql
derive [x = 1, y = 2]
derive [
  a = x,
  b = y
]
derive [
  c = a,
  d = b,
]
```

Most transforms can take either a list or a single item, so these are
equivalent:

```prql
from employees
select [first_name]
```

```prql
from employees
select first_name
```

## Parentheses

Parentheses — `()` — are used to give precedence to inner expressions, as is the
case in almost all languages / math.

In particular, parentheses are used to nest pipelines for transforms such as
`group` and `window`, which take a pipeline. Here, the `aggregate` pipeline is
applied to each group of unique `title` and `country` values.

```prql
from employees
group [title, country] (
  aggregate [
    average salary,
    ct = count
  ]
)
```

## Comments

Comments are represented by `#`. Currently only single line comments exist.

```prql
from employees  # Comment 1
# Comment 2
aggregate [average salary]
```

## Backticks

To use identifiers that are otherwise invalid, surround them with backticks.
Depending on the dialect, these will remain as backticks or be converted to double-quotes

```prql
prql dialect:bigquery
from `project-foo.dataset.table`
join `project-bar.dataset.table` [col_bax]
```

```prql
prql dialect:postgres
from employees
select `first name`
```
