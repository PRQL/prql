      It starts with FROM, it fixes trailing commas, and it's called PRQL?? If
      this is a dream, don't wake me up.

      I'm also really excited about efforts to create entire new query languages
      that compile to SQL, like Malloy and PRQL.

      A few years ago, I started working on a language, called "dsql", short for
      declarative SQL, and a pun on "the sequel (to SQL)". I kinda chickened out
      of it then, the amount of study and research I needed was massive. prql
      here is better than I imagined: github.com/max-sixty/prql

      SQL's hold on data retrieval is slipping! 8 new databases are emerging,
      and some speak entirely new languages for data querying. Know more

      I want to give the PRQL a little boost here, "pipeline of transformations"
      is IMHO a good choice for readable query languages that need to deal with
      SQL-like aggregations, group by and count and sum all:

      Having written some complex dbt projects...the first thing...it gets right
      is to start with the table and work down. This is an enormous readability
      boost in large projects and leads to great intellisense.
