# Relations

PRQL is designed on top of _relational algebra_, which is the established data
model used by modern SQL databases. A _relation_ has a rigid mathematical
definition, which can be simplified to "a table of data". For example, the
`invoices` table from the Chinook database
([https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database))
looks like this:

| invoice_id | customer_id | billing_city | _other columns_ | total |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | :-------------: | ----- |
| 1          | 2           | Stuttgart    |       ...       | 1.98  |
| 2          | 4           | Oslo         |       ...       | 3.96  |
| 3          | 8           | Brussels     |       ...       | 5.94  |
| 4          | 14          | Edmonton     |       ...       | 8.91  |
| 5          | 23          | Boston       |       ...       | 13.86 |
| 6          | 37          | Frankfurt    |       ...       | 0.99  |

A relation is composed of rows. Each row in a relation contains a value for each
of the relation's columns. Each column in a relation has a unique name and a
designated data type. The table above is a relation, and has columns named
`invoice_id`and `customer_id` each with a data type of "integer number", a
`billing_city` column with a data type of "text", several other columns, and a
`total` column that contains floating-point numbers.

## Queries

The main purpose of PRQL is to build queries that combine and transform data
from relations such as the `invoices` table above. Here is the most basic query:

```prql no-eval
from invoices
```

```admonish note
Try each of these examples here in the
[Playground.](https://prql-lang.org/playground/) Enter the query on the
left-hand side, and click **output.arrow** in the right-hand side to see the
result.
```

The result of the query above is not terribly interesting, it's just the same
relation as before.

### `select` transform

The `select` function picks the columns to pass through based on a list and
discards all others. Formally, that list is a _tuple_ of comma-separated
expressions wrapped in `{ ... }`.

Suppose we only need the `order_id` and `total` columns. Use `select` to choose
the columns to pass through. _(Try it in the
[Playground.](https://prql-lang.org/playground/))_

```prql no-eval
from invoices
select { order_id, total }
```

We can write the items in the tuple on one or several lines: trailing commas are
ignored. In addition, we can assign any of the expressions to a _variable_ that
becomes the name of the resulting column in the SQL output.

```prql no-eval
from invoices
select {
  OrderID = invoice_id,
  Total = total,
}
```

This is the same query as above, rewritten on multiple lines, and assigning
`OrderID` and `Total` names to the columns.

Once we `select` certain columns, subsequent transforms will have access only to
those columns named in the tuple.

### `derive` transform

To add columns to a relation, we can use the `derive` function. Let's define a
new column for Value Added Tax, set at 19% of the invoice total.

```prql no-eval
from invoices
derive { VAT = total * 0.19 }
```

<!-- todo: make sure that the new column is unnamed -->

The value of the new column can be a constant (such as a number or a string), or
can be computed from the value of an existing column. Note that the value of the
new column is assigned the name `VAT`.

### `join` transform

The `join` transform also adds columns to the relation by combining the rows
from two relations "side by side". To determine which rows from each relation
should be joined, `join` has match criteria, written in `( ... )`.

```prql no-eval
from invoices
join customers ( ==customer_id )
```

This example "connects" the customer information from the `customers` relation
with the information from the `invoices` relation, using identical values of the
`customer_id` column from each relation to match the rows.

It is frequently useful to assign an alias to both relations being joined
together so that each relation's columns can be referred to uniquely.

```prql no-eval
from inv=invoices
join cust=customers ( ==customer_id )
```

In the example above, the alias `inv` represents the `invoices` relation and
`cust` represents the `customers` relation. It then becomes possible to refer to
`inv.billing_city` and `cust.last_name` unambiguously.

### Summary

PRQL manipulates relations (tables) of data. The `derive`, `select`, and `join`
transforms change the number of columns in a table. The first two never affect
the number of rows in a table. `join` may change the number of rows, depending
on the chosen type of join.

This final example combines the above into a single query. It illustrates _a
pipeline_ - the fundamental basis of PRQL. We simply add new lines (transforms)
at the end of the query. Each transform modifies the relation produced by the
statement above to produce the desired result.

```prql no-eval
from inv=invoices
join cust=customers (==customer_id)
derive { VAT = inv.total * 0.19 }
select {
  OrderID = inv.invoice_id,
  CustomerName = cust.last_name,
  Total = inv.total,
  VAT,
}
```

<!-- PRQL uses the data from... _Where does our data come from? Do we use some canonical version?_ -->
