# Examples

These examples are rewritten from other languages such as SQL. They try to
express real-world problems in PRQL, covering most of the language features. We
are looking for different use-cases of data transformation, be it database
queries, semantic business modeling or data cleaning.

- [Variables](./variables.md)
- [List equivalence](./list-equivalence.md)
- [CTE (intermediate tables)](./cte.md)
- [Employees](./employees.md)

If you want to help, translate some of your queries to PRQL and
[open a PR](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/pulls) to add them here!
