# From

Specifies a data source.

```prql
from artists
```

To introduce an alias, use an assign expression:

```prql
from e = employees
select e.first_name
```

Table names containing spaces or special characters
[need to be contained within backticks](../syntax/keywords.md#quoting):

```prql
from `artist tracks`
```

`default_db.tablename` can be used if the table name matches a function from the
standard library.

```admonish note
We realize this is an awkward workaround. Track & üëç [#3271](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues/3271) for resolving this.
```

```prql
default_db.group  # in place of `from group`
take 1
```
