# Name resolution

Because PRQL primarily handles relational data, it has specialized scoping rules
for referencing columns.

## Scopes

In PRQL's compiler, a scope is the collection of all names one can reference
from a specific point in the program.

In PRQL, names in the scope are composed from namespace and variable name which
are separated by a dot, similar to SQL. Namespaces can contain many dots, but
variable names cannot.

```admonish example
Name `my_table.some_column` is a variable `some_column` from namespace `my_table`.

Name `foo.bar.baz` is a variable `baz` from namespace `foo.bar`.
```

When processing a query, a scope is maintained and updated for each point in the
query.

It start with only namespace `std`, which is the standard library. It contains
common functions like `sum` or `count`, along with all transform functions such
as `derive` and `group`.

In pipelines (or rather in transform functions), scope is also injected with
namespaces of tables which may have been referenced with `from` or `join`
transforms. These namespaces contain simply all the columns of the table and
possibly a wildcard variable, which matches any variable (see the algorithm
below). Within transforms, there is also a special namespace that does not have
a name. It is called a _"frame"_ and it contains columns of the current table
the transform is operating on.

## Resolving

For each ident we want to resolve, we search the scope's items in order. One of
three things can happen:

- Scope contains an exact match, e.g. a name that matches in namespace and the
  variable name.

- Scope does not contain an exact match, but the ident did not specify a
  namespace, so we can match a namespace that contains a `*` wildcard. If
  there's a single namespace, the matched namespace is also updated to contain
  this new variable name.

- Otherwise, the nothing is matched and an error is raised.

## Translating to SQL

When translating into an SQL statement which references only one table, there is
no need to reference column names with table prefix.

```prql
from employees
select first_name
```

But when there are multiple tables and we don't have complete knowledge of all
table columns, a column without a prefix (i.e. `first_name`) may actually reside
in multiple tables. Because of this, we have to use table prefixes for all
column names.

```prql
from employees
derive {first_name, dept_id}
join d=departments (==dept_id)
select {first_name, d.title}
```

As you can see, `employees.first_name` now needs table prefix, to prevent
conflicts with potential column with the same name in `departments` table.
Similarly, `d.title` needs the table prefix.
