# Visual Studio Code extension

PRQL has a Visual Studio Code extension that compiles a PRQL query in a VS Code
editor and displays the resulting SQL code in a second pane on the side. This is
very handy for editing, saving, and reusing PRQL queries in VS Code.

To install the VS Code extension, open VS Code and type
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>P</kbd>
(<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>P</kbd> on a Mac) and type `PRQL`. Install
the extension as usual.
