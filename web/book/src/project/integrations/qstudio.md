# qStudio IDE

qStudio is a SQL GUI that lets you browse tables, run SQL scripts, and chart and
export the results. qStudio runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, and works with
every popular database including mysql, postgresql, mssql, kdb....

qStudio calls the `prqlc` compiler to generate SQL code from PRQL queries (.prql
files). Check out the [qStudio site](https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/) for
