# Strings

Strings in PRQL can use either single or double quotes:

```prql
from my_table
select x = "hello world"
```

```prql
from my_table
select x = 'hello world'
```

To quote a string containing quotes, either use the "other" type of quote, or
use 3, 4, 5 or 6 quotes, and close with the same number.

```prql
from my_table
select x = '"hello world"'
```

```prql
from my_table
select x = """I said "hello world"!"""
```

```prql
from my_table
select x = """""I said """hello world"""!"""""
```

Strings can also contain any escape defined by
[JSON standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/).

```prql
from my_table
select x = "\t\tline ends here\n \\ "
```

## F-Strings and S-Strings

These special case strings can be used to:

[F-strings](./f-strings.md) - Build up a new string from a set of columns or
values

[S-strings](./s-strings.md) - Insert SQL statements directly into the query. Use
when PRQL doesn't have an equivalent facility.

```admonish warning
Currently PRQL allows multiline strings with either a single character or
multiple character quotes. This may change for strings using a single character
quote in future versions.
