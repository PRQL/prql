# Loop

> _Experimental_

```prql no-eval
loop {step_function} {initial_relation}
```

Iteratively applies `step` function to `initial` relation until the `step`
returns an empty table. Returns a relation that contains rows of initial
relation and all intermediate relations.

This behavior could be expressed with following pseudo-code:

```python
def loop(step, initial):
    result = []
    current = initial
    while current is not empty:
        result = append(result, current)
        current = step(current)

    return result
```

## Examples

```prql
from [{n = 1}]
loop (
    filter n<4
    select n = n+1
)

# returns [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

```admonish note
The behavior of `WITH RECURSIVE` may depend on the database configuration in MySQL.
The compiler assumes the behavior described by
the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-with.html#QUERIES-WITH-RECURSIVE)
and will not produce correct results for
[alternative configurations of MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html#common-table-expressions-recursive).
```

```admonish note
Currently, `loop` may produce references to the recursive CTE in sub-queries,
which is not supported by some database engines, e.g. SQLite. For now, we suggest step
functions are kept simple enough to fit into a single SELECT statement.
