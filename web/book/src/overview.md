# Overview

PRQL project documentation.

## [Tutorial](./tutorial/relations.md)

A friendly & accessible guide for learning PRQL. It has a gradual increase of
difficulty and requires only basic understanding of programming languages.
Knowledge of SQL is beneficial, because of many comparisons to SQL, but it is
not required.
