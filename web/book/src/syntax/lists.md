# Lists

Lists are represented with `[]`, and can span multiple lines. A final trailing
comma is optional.

```prql
from numbers
derive [x = 1, y = 2]
derive [
  a = x,
  b = y
]
derive [
  c = a,
  d = b,
]
```

Most transforms can take either a list or a single item, so these are
equivalent:

```prql
from employees
select [first_name]
```

```prql
from employees
select first_name
```
