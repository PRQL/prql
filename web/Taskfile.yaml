      Build the web products for distribution - Website, Book, and Playground.
    cmds:
      - cd website && hugo --minify
      - cd book && mdbook build
      - mkdir -p website/public
      # Copy the book into the website path, using rsync so it only copies new files
      - rsync -ai --checksum --delete book/book/ website/public/book/
      # (we don't use `build-playground-dependencies`, since that uses the dev profile)
      - cd playground && npm ci && npm run build
      # We place the playground app in a nested path, because we want to use
      # prql-lang.org/playground with an iframe containing the playground.
      # Possibly there's a more elegant way of doing this...

    # Check if npm dependencies for the playground need to be updated

# These tasks have been factored out in favor of the remaining tasks
# run-web:
#   desc: Build & serve the website & playground.
#   summary:
#     Note that this only live-reloads the static website; and requires
#     rerunning to pick up playground & book changes.

#   desc: Build & serve the playground, without rebuilding rust code.
#   dir: web/playground
