# PRQL Playground

A fast-feedback compiler from PRQL to SQL, hosted at
<https://prql-lang.org/playground/>

To run locally,
[set up a development environment](https://prql-lang.org/book/project/contributing/development.html),
and then run:

```sh
task web:run-playground
```

...or use the commands which that command calls from
[our Taskfile](../Taskfile.yaml).
